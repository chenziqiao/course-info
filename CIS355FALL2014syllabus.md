####Course Description and Objectives
CIS 355 serves as a hands-on introduction to data warehousing.  The three major chunks of CIS 355 will be:

1. A brief introduction to relational databases and the design of transactional database systems. This technology is the foundation of a data warehouse and necessary to understand the source systems from which data warehouses draw data.
2. A dive into dimensional modeling for analytical information systems.  Students will understand how (and why) data models for business intelligence applications differ from transactional systems, and will explore dimensional modeling theory through several case studies.
3. A study of the process of constructing DW/BI systems, particularly focusing on the dark arts of data wrangling and ETL.  If there is time, we will experiment with some cutting-edge tools like Hadoop in the cloud.

This is the first semester we've offered this course at ASU, so I expect it to be an interactive workshop and a learning experience for the students and instructor alike.  If possible we will incorporate guest speakers and tech talks on some of the latest techniques.

High-level objectives are that by the end of the course, students can:

- Implement simple databases in an RDBMS with SQL
- Sketch out data models for transactional and analytical systems, understanding the difference between them
- Understand the architecture and design of a complete DW/BI application
- Use tools for extracting, transforming, and loading data into a data warehouse

Note that the entire syllabus and schedule are likely to evolve over the next few months.

####Course Materials 
One textbook is required reading for this course:

1. *The Data Warehouse Toolkit*, by Ralph Kimball & Margy Ross.  Wiley, 2013.   ISBN: 978-1-118-53080-1   ($35 on Amazon)

####Email/Online Communication 
One of my jobs is to help you deal with obstacles and get the resources or help you need to succeed in this course, so I encourage you to stay in communication with me.  When e-mailing me, please indicate in the subject line that it is for CIS 355.  Be sure to sign it with your full name, and state your problem clearly.  You can expect me to check my e-mail at the beginning and end of the work day, but not necessarily on weekends or at night.  If you think you’ll need urgent help outside of the work week, let me know in advance.


####Examinations 
There are two exams in the course, a midterm and a final.  I have not yet determined the formats.
	
####Group Policies 
You will form groups of 3-4 members for the course project.  It is important to make sure you are working well with your teammates.  When forming teams, it is *strongly* recommended that you communicate frankly about expectations and identify any potential problems early on.  

A student may be kicked off the project team by unanimous agreement of the other team members for being disruptive or not contributing to the work, subject to my agreement.  If a student is kicked off his team, I may (at my discretion) propose an alternative project for the student to be able to complete the course.  It will likely be difficult and the grading will be subjective, so I strongly recommend not getting into this situation.  If you do perceive a problem to be developing, ask for help before it is too late.

####Late Work
Most assignments are due at the end of the day on the due date (i.e. midnight).  If I receive them late within the next 7 days, I'll accept them but take 25% off.  I usually don't accept work later than 7 days after the due date.  Work that is due to be delivered during class time (i.e. presentations) cannot be accepted late.  Contact me if you need an accommodation for some kind of emergency.

####Class Attendance and Participation 
Class attendance is necessary to achieve the maximum benefit from this class. You are expected to attend every class. Excessive absences will affect a student’s course grade and/or result in removal from the course.  If a student is unable to attend class for any reason, they should notify the instructor and their teammates as soon as possible by email.  In accordance with ASU policies, accommodations will be made for students observing religious holidays, or missing class related to university-sanctioned activities.  Please let me know as early as possible.
- ASU calendar of religious holidays (sorry, Pastafarians): https://provost.asu.edu/index.php?q=religious-holiday-calendar
- Policy on university-sanctioned activities (ACD 304-02): http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-02.html

####Academic Integrity  
From the ASU General Catalog:  “The highest standards of academic integrity are expected of all students. Failure to meet these standards may result in suspension or expulsion from the university and other sanctions as specified in the academic integrity policies of the individual colleges.”  By law and regulation, this course will be conducted within the ethical standards of ASU at large, which preclude such activities as plagiarism, cheating, and various forms of harassment.  Statement/policy on these issues:    http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity

####Students with Disabilities
If you wish to request accommodation for a disability, you need to be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) and provide documentation from the DRC.

####Threatening or Disruptive Behavior
We will follow the ASU Student Services Manual (SSM 104-02) if there are any cases of disruptive, threatening, or violent behavior that arise.  Individuals can be asked to leave the premises or the police may be called in an extreme situation.

####Classroom Etiquette, Professionalism and the Learning Environment
It is an extremely high priority of your instructor that the classroom experience be one that promotes a learning environment for all students present. Students, taxpayers and many other University stakeholders have paid of their money, time and resources to make this classroom environment available to you. There are a variety of behaviors which are violations of classroom etiquette because they (1) distract other students, (2) distract the instructor, and (3) distract the student exhibiting the behavior. In order to assure an environment that promotes learning for everyone present the following behaviors will absolutely not be tolerated:

1. Using your laptop (surfing the web) for anything other than class business.
2. Talking during inappropriate times.
3. Showing up late for class.
4. Doing homework for another class during the normally scheduled class time.
5. Listening and/or viewing audio/video devices during class.

Each instance where a student is found to be in violation of classroom etiquette will cost that student 1% off the total 100% available for the class score. There is no limit to the number of percentage points a student may lose due to these violations.
