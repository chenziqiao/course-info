####Course Description and Objectives
CIS 355 serves as a hands-on introduction to working with data, developing databases including data warehouses, and designing data apps for business users.  Students will receive a survey of the discipline now being called "data engineering" that supports the perhaps more high profile work of data science and analytics.  After completing CIS 355, students should be comfortable acquiring and preparing data for assignments and projects they may encounter in subsequent courses, and should be able to envision the design of data "products" such as web services and business intelligence applications. 

The topics included in CIS 355 include:

1. What data looks like in the wild: APIs, serialization formats, and practical constraints
2. Acquiring and sharing data online, and at scale, with a hands-on introduction to "the cloud"
3. An introduction to databases and the variety of data models emerging in the big data era
4. Relational databases and SQL, introduced in the context of data application development
5. Dimensional modeling and data warehouses: how OLAP and OLTP necessitate different designs
6. Emerging technologies: analytical databases, Hadoop, and data streams (as schedule permits)

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Acquire data from an API, transform it into a desired format using a scripting language, or load it into a database
- Create a simple web application or RESTful web service to make the data available to business users or downstream applications
- Sketch out the design of a "data pipeline" from source systems to end users using appropriate technologies for the job
- Design dimensional models for business intelligence, load data, and use SQL to write business intelligence queries

Note that the syllabus and schedule are likely to change during the semester.

####Course Materials 
One textbook is required reading for this course:

1. *Data Just Right*, by Michael Manoocherhri.  Addison Wesley, 2014.   ISBN: 978-0321898654   ($26 on Amazon)

Note: The book is NOT in the bookstore! The bookstore is carrying last semester's required title, *The Data Warehouse Toolkit*, which is no longer required.  Buy *Data Just Right* online.

In addition, my course notes will be required reading, and they are under development here: https://github.com/joeclark-phd/databook

####W. P. Carey School Learning Objectives
The Undergraduate Program of the W. P. Carey School of Business has established the following learning goals for its graduates:

1. Critical thinking
2. Communication
3. Discipline specific knowledge
4. Ethical awareness and reasoning
5. Global awareness

Items #1-#3 have significant coverage in this course.

####Grade Breakdown
Grades will be assigned based on the following scale:

<60: E  
60-69.99: D  
70-76.99: C  
77-79.99: C+  
80-82.99: B-  
83-86.99: B  
87-89.99: B+  
90-92.99: A-  
93-96.99: A  
97+: A+

####Assignments
Course assignments are weighted toward the final grade as follows:

**TBD**



####Email/Online Communication 
One of my jobs is to help you deal with obstacles and get the resources or help you need to succeed in this course, so I encourage you to stay in communication with me.  When e-mailing me, please indicate in the subject line that it is for CIS 355.  Be sure to sign it with your full name, and state your problem clearly.  You can expect me to check my e-mail at the beginning and end of the work day, but not necessarily on weekends or at night.  If you think you’ll need urgent help outside of the work week, let me know in advance.

####Examinations 
There are two exams in the course, a midterm and a final.  I have not yet determined the formats.
	
####Group Policies 
You will form groups of 3-4 members for the course project.  It is important to make sure you are working well with your teammates.  When forming teams, it is *strongly* recommended that you communicate frankly about expectations and identify any potential problems early on.  At the time of the final exam, teammates will have a chance to grade one another on their performance.  If students would like to change their teams for a good reason, I will consider such changes on a case-by-case basis.

####Late Work
Most assignments are due at the end of the day on the due date (i.e. midnight).  If I receive them late within the next 7 days, I'll accept them but take 25% off.  I usually don't accept work later than 7 days after the due date.  Work that is due to be delivered during class time (i.e. presentations) cannot be accepted late.  Contact me if you need an accommodation for some kind of emergency.

####Class Attendance and Participation 
Class attendance is necessary to achieve the maximum benefit from this class. You are expected to attend every class. Excessive absences will affect a student’s course grade and/or result in removal from the course.  If a student is unable to attend class for any reason, they should notify the instructor and their teammates as soon as possible by email.  In accordance with ASU policies, accommodations will be made for students observing religious holidays, or missing class related to university-sanctioned activities.  Please let me know as early as possible.

- Policy on university-sanctioned activities (ACD 304-02): http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-02.html

####Academic Integrity  
From the ASU General Catalog:  “The highest standards of academic integrity are expected of all students. Failure to meet these standards may result in suspension or expulsion from the university and other sanctions as specified in the academic integrity policies of the individual colleges.”  By law and regulation, this course will be conducted within the ethical standards of ASU at large, which preclude such activities as plagiarism, cheating, and various forms of harassment.  Statement/policy on these issues:    http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity

####Students with Disabilities
If you wish to request accommodation for a disability, you need to be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) and provide documentation from the DRC.

####Threatening or Disruptive Behavior
We will follow the ASU Student Services Manual (SSM 104-02) if there are any cases of disruptive, threatening, or violent behavior that arise.  Individuals can be asked to leave the premises or the police may be called in an extreme situation.

####Classroom Etiquette, Professionalism and the Learning Environment
It is an extremely high priority of your instructor that the classroom experience be one that promotes a learning environment for all students present. Students, taxpayers and many other University stakeholders have paid of their money, time and resources to make this classroom environment available to you. There are a variety of behaviors which are violations of classroom etiquette because they (1) distract other students, (2) distract the instructor, and (3) distract the student exhibiting the behavior. In order to assure an environment that promotes learning for everyone present the following behaviors will absolutely not be tolerated:

1. Using your laptop (surfing the web) for anything other than class business.
2. Talking during inappropriate times.
3. Showing up late for class.
4. Doing homework for another class during the normally scheduled class time.
5. Listening and/or viewing audio/video devices during class.

Each instance where a student is found to be in violation of classroom etiquette will cost that student 1% off the total 100% available for the class score. There is no limit to the number of percentage points a student may lose due to these violations.
