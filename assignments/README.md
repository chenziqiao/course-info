### Assignments for CIS 355

There are three major assignments in CIS 355.  Overviews follow.

- Transactional Database Development (20 pts)
    - Your team has selected a chapter from the Kimball textbook (from ch. 7-16) as a "case study" for the course project.  In the first series of assignments, you will design and build a transactional (operational) database for the case study.  This should get you up to speed with SQL, ER Diagramming, and the basics of logical/physical database implementation.
    - **Subtasks:**
        - **Repository Setup (5pts) (due Sept. 3):** Set up your team's repository on GitHub and initialize it with a README file that identifies team members and the case study.
        - **ER Diagram & Requirements (5pts) (due Sept. 17):** Document the requirements for your database in terms of "business rules" and draw an ER diagram for a database that reflects those requirements.  The files should be committed to your GitHub repo.
        - **Transactional Database Implementation (5pts) (due Sept. 22):** Code the SQL that will implement your database in PostgreSQL.  This should be a series of CREATE TABLE statements with correct data types, primary and foreign keys.  Commit this code to your GitHub repo.
        - **Database Tests (5pts) (due Sept. 24):**  Write queries in SQL that *test* your database to make sure it does everything it's supposed to.  Update the requirements, ER diagram, and database creation code in GitHub if they need to change to make it work.  In the test script, use comments to tell me what each test is supposed to prove, and what output is expected.
            
- Dimensional Database Development (20 pts)
    - Your team will develop a dimensional database (a data warehouse) in stages.  More details TBD.
    - **Subtasks:**
        - Requirements part 1 (5pts)
        - Requirements part 2 (5pts)
        - Transforms part 1 (5pts)
        - Transforms part 2 (5pts)    

- Final Presentations (20 pts)
    - Your final presentation and report will recap what you learned from your course project; keep track of what you learn about the case study, about transactional database design, and about dimensional database design.  In particular make note of issues/challenges that pertain especially to your case study more than others.
    - **Subtasks:**
        - In-class "Tech Talk" (10pts)
        - Project Report (10pts)
