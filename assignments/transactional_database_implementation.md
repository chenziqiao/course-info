### Transactional Database Implementation Task

**Transactional Database Implementation (5pts) (due Sept. 22):** Code the SQL that will implement your database in PostgreSQL.  This should be a series of CREATE TABLE statements with correct data types, primary and foreign keys.  Commit this code to your GitHub repo.

---

For this assignment you'll provide one script file consisting of several SQL "CREATE TABLE" statements that define the tables in your database.  They should be consistent with the ER diagram you provided in the previous assignment.

To grade this assignment, I'll copy the text from this file and paste it into PostgreSQL and try to run it to create your tables.  Therefore you should test the code as you are writing it, and don't submit until it works... *unless you are stumped and want help from me and your classmates.*  In the latter case, post what you have to your team's GitHub repo, and we can all take a crack at improving it.

I will expect primary keys defined, but you don't have to do foreign keys if you don't understand them yet.  And I don't expect everything perfect the first time, so don't wait until the last minute -- try something, put it online, and we can all help triage it.  I encourage collaboration here.  No one will be penalized for getting help from other classmates, as long as you at least started it on your own.
