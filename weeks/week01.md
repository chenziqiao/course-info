###Week 1

Stuff for Monday:

1. Buy the textbook, read the table of contents (TOC) and introduction.  Chapters #7-16 are case studies on different industries, and you will want to choose one of these to research for the course project.  So think about it.

2. Install Git.
3. Create an account on GitHub.com.  I will ask you for your account name.
