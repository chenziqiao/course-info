###Week 2

Monday is Labor Day, don't come to class!

This week I'm going to get started with databases.  I chose not to assign a database textbook for the class, but you might want something to read before the lecture.  I happen to like these late 1990s articles by Philip Greenspun: [http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/](http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/)... check out the Preface and Introduction.  Note that the SQL dialect he used was a bit different from the one we'll use in PostgreSQL.

Stuff for Wednesday:

1. Bring a pen or pencil and paper to the lecture.
2. Try to get a README file into your project repository that lists the team members and tells me which case study your project will be on.  That'll be enough.  I'll give you guidelines for the project's milestones this week.
