###Week 3

Stuff for Monday:

Another conceptual lecture, come prepared to take notes.  I will play with the software a bit, but we'll do more of that on wednesday.

Stuff for Wednesday:

1. Bring your laptop and (if possible) have PostgreSQL installed.  The latest stable version available from www.postgresql.org should be fine.  Last time I checked it was 9.3.5.  Older versions are probably fine too.

2. We'll create and import a database from a script, and then run a bunch of SQL queries on it.  I will provide all this on a handout and github.
