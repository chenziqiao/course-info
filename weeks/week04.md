###Week 4

Stuff for Monday:

Today was the IS career mixer.  I introduced the transactional database assignments but the first will not be due until Wednesday.  I have updated the course schedule -- check it.

Stuff for Wednesday:

1. Your database requirements doc is going to be due at midnight tonight, so we'll work on it in class.  Bring pens, paper, and your computers as this will be a working class.  If you've done the requirements, you can start writing SQL.
